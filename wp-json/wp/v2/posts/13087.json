In fact, I never lie to you guys about the workouts I do or the food I eat&#8230; but, here is what I mean- I don&#8217;t post my whole life.<\/div>\n<div>When you look at my page,\u00a0all you see are my workouts, healthy recipes and other fitness-related tips. I don&#8217;t show my &#8220;cheat meals&#8221; or days I don&#8217;t feel like working out.<\/div>\n<div>I think social media can be sooo deceptive to what some girls\u2019 exercise and eating regimes are. Especially someone like me, a fitness chick who promotes a healthy lifestyle and working out constantly.<\/div>\n<div>Of course,\u00a0I want to promote a healthy lifestyle and be a huge fitness advocate to you as much as possible. Though, I don\u2019t want you to get\u00a0too caught up in what you think is a &#8220;healthy lifestyle&#8221; because of what is shown on Insta. (Am I making any sense here!?) Meaning, I want you to realize fitness is not\u00a0my whole life. Do I always try my best? Yes. Do I sometimes fail and give up at a workout? Yes. I&#8217;m not some crazyyy fitness girl, trust me.\u00a0<strong>I am just a regular girl trying to stay in shape like you, reach my fitness goals, and gain confidence while doing it. <\/strong><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I don\u2019t need to workout for over an hour a day to do so. I don\u2019t need to restrain myself from pasta and fries. And I sure don\u2019t need to give up my social life (and marrrgsss) to be healthy. LOL to that.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>You probably scroll through social media, and see fitness girls promoting their perfect healthy lifestyles, perfect workout regimes, etc.. and hey- that can even get ME down on myself. (I be like dammnnn how does she do that, how she so pretty, how she so fit though lol)<\/div>\n<div>Just realize that some things you see as you scroll, aren\u2019t real life. And it\u00a0can really get to your head if you\u00a0compare what you\u00a0see on social media to your real life. Everyone\u00a0has days where they feel like poop and don&#8217;t workout. Oh and FYI, those skinny teas, those supplement pills, the diet &#8220;vitamins&#8221; are sometimes falsely advertised or not even used at all by the person promoting it.\u00a0Sometimes the advocate of any of that is just in it for the money. That\u2019s the harsh reality of the fitness bizz.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>To be honest, I don&#8217;t want to be one of those girls. The ones who promote that &#8220;perfect&#8221; healthy fitness lifestyle, all. the. time. That is not practical for any of us. I don&#8217;t want to drive you guys insane about how you&#8217;re &#8220;supposed&#8221; to be working out and eating. I don\u2019t want you to be intimidated or think\u00a0that I workout 24\/7. Lol. I\u2019d die. On average, I workout for 30-35 minutes a day, 4-6 times a week. Sometimes when I travel or feel under the weather, I workout 2-3 days a week just because THAT IS LIFE! I don\u2019t think i\u2019ve ever worked out every single day in a week. I don\u2019t find it realistic or healthy to be that obsessed with exercising.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>\n<div>ANYWAYS, <strong>I want you guys to know that I will\u00a0always be open and HONEST with you.<\/strong> With that, I think you all can tell that I actually do my workouts because they are follow along videos, and obviously with that, I have to complete them too!! Hahah. I\u2019ve also done both my 8 week guide (TWICE!) and my 10 day guide, and those are the EXACT workouts I do. But besides the fact of possibly creating the &#8220;perfect workout girl 24\/7&#8221; illusion to you all, here is my time to be honest:<\/div>\n<div>Sometimes I don\u2019t have the best motivation to workout, sometimes I sit and have a whole carton of ice cream because I feel sorry for myself. Sometimes I sit on the couch instead of working out. Oh, and I definitely don&#8217;t\u00a0workout when I\u2019m hungover.\u00a0<strong>I AM HUMAN<\/strong>. Again, I am not this superior fitness girl who only cares about working out and being fit. I spend way more time focusing on my family, friends, career, and doing things I love, including\u00a0Taco Tuesday. To sum it up, inspiring others through a healthy lifestyle is 100% my passion, but working out is not 100% of my LIFE, and working out should never consume 100% of anyone\u2019s life.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><strong>We need BALANCE in our lives. At all times.<\/strong><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>At the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t matter what others are doing. Never compare your fitness journey to anyone else&#8217;s. So what if I worked out more days than you one week, or you ate better than me?\u00a0<strong>It&#8217;s only about YOU.<\/strong>\u00a0If there is anything to take from this little message I&#8217;m writing, it&#8217;s that <strong>it only matters to be honest with yourself.<\/strong> YOU are the only one who truly knows if you gave it your all with your weekly workouts, and gave your best effort with eating healthy. Nobody else! Also, every body is totally different. Progress is shown so differently throughout one girl to the next. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s not always about the physical.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>If I\u00a0skip a day? I move on. Eat cupcakes? Yeah, it happens. Just get back on track, do your best, and stay positive.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I never want to give\u00a0you unrealistic fitness standards. I just want to inspire you to implement fitness into your daily lifestyle <strong>as it fits YOUR WORLD realistically<\/strong> and help you realize that <strong>you CAN do it<\/strong>!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I hope this helps you in some way feel more CONFIDENT within yourself! Because you are SO worth it.<\/div>\n<div>To bring back my motto from my home page: &#8220;This is your story, I\u2019m just joining you on your journey to get fit and have fun with it! I\u2019m here to help you get motivated and stay motivated \u2014 and I\u2019m cheering for you every step of the way.&#8221;<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Love,<\/div>\n<div>Katie<\/div>\n<div>Also please excuse any grammar mistakes and flow of sentences. You now know why I am a &#8220;V&#8221;logger and not a &#8220;B&#8221;logger hahaha<\/div>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Something I just wanted to tell ya: I don\u2019t workout like you probably think.
