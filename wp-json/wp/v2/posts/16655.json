Bullsh*t, or for real?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">All the goals you hear people setting &amp; maybe even asking you <em>your<\/em> resolutions&#8230; it can be a daunting to think about.&nbsp; Is it all nonsense??<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I can see why you can think this &#8220;new year, new you&#8221; whole thang is a bit stupid, because you can start on your fitness goals any time of the year, so what&#8217;s the craze about hitting a new month?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Well, there&#8217;s definitely a side of me that LOVES the new-year-new-me mindset.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Why? Because as humans, we love the idea of a fresh beginning. The mindset that we could start over again, without any guilt from the year before. Clean slate.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>So what\u2019s going to allow you to press that restart button<\/strong>?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">First off, find your motivation. But the catch is, what motivates me, <em>might not work for you<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And not to be cliche here, my motivation usually comes from YOU guys. (I freakin love seeing y\u2019all kill your workouts and feel good within, makes my world)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For YOU, this motivation has to be personal. It can be anythinngggg; maybe it\u2019s more pushups this month than you could do last month, maybe it&#8217;s wanting to look damn good when you\u2019re on spring break, or maybe you want to feel better after a break up (and make him jealous with a hot bod\u2026.duh) Whatever that motivation is, make it specific to you.<\/p>\n<p>Also, the truth of the matter is, you might not always be motivated.. that&#8217;s why we must create working out a habit! So you still do it even when you&#8217;re not motivated.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, as overachievers, we want to tell ourselves that we are going to go to EXTREMES to be successful in weight-loss, fitness goals, our careers, diets, etc. But to be honest, that\u2019s the reason these New Years resolutions truly never stick. I bet you that last year, by the time February hit, you kindaaaa were slacking on your goals.<\/p>\n<p>So how can we make that goal, that vision, <strong>ATTAINABLE<\/strong> and <strong>LAST?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, that\u2019s giving yourself realistic goals.<\/p>\n<p>I know looking all the whole year from January to December can be a little discouraging. So that is why taking it month by month, and even week by week is so important. So my advice to you is setting your goals in weeks of 2.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Setting SHORT TERM goals<\/strong>, in steps of your LONG TERM goal is vital. Just looking at that long term goal can be discouraging.<\/p>\n<p>Here is an example for a weightloss goal:<br \/>\nLongterm goal: I want to lose 20 pounds (yeah, daunting)<br \/>\nShort term goal: I want to lose 2 pounds every two weeks.<br \/>\nKeep tabs on only every 2 weeks. And celebrate small wins.<\/p>\n<p>This even goes for something not related to fitness. I actually get asked the question of \u201chow did you get started doing this fitness blogging stuff?\u201d all the time. So let\u2019s take that for example. Say you want to create something, and you\u2019re looking at creating a website, a logo, a media kit, a bio, an intro video, collabs\u2026. well shoooot, the list can go on when you\u2019re trying to start something new or chase after a dream. Trust me, looking at everything you need to do or want to accomplish in the new year is scary for me. That\u2019s why you must take one thing at a time. Work hard on a project for a couple weeks, give it your all, then move on to the next. Of course, in the back of your mind knowing the end goal is important, but knowing it will take steps to get there is huge to realize. (I\u2019m still working on understanding this!!)<\/p>\n<p>Bottom line, be patient with achieving your goals. Nobody accomplishes ANYTHING overnight. Whatever your goals are for this year, make sure you make them practical for yourself. You\u2019re more likely to give up if your intentions are not realistic. And I never want you to give up\u2026<\/p>\n<p>3 words that I feel like I always say when it comes to attaining a goal, and they\u2019re so necessary in this instance.<\/p>\n<p><em>PASSION. PERSISTENCE. PATIENCE.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Find that motivation. Create your goal. Track it weekly. Try your best.<\/p>\n<p>Now write down your <em>WHY<\/em> and your <em>GOALS<\/em>, put them above your bed so you see them every single day, and GO GET EM TIGER!!!<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNever give up on something you can\u2019t go a day without thinking about\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>xo<br \/>\nKatie<\/em><\/p>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NEW YEAR, NEW YOU.
