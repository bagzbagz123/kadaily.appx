This time, I\u2019m finally writing down my resolutions! Usually, my goals fall through within several weeks, but this year I\u2019m DETERMINED to work hard at all five of them.<\/p>\n<p>A few are goals I\u2019ve had for a while now but haven\u2019t actively pursued, but I know that by focusing on each of them, I will be successful.<\/p>\n<p>The new year is always a great time to start forming habits or start on goals you always wanted to achieve. I suggest you also write yours down like I have! Keep them in your notes, on your phone, anywhere close, to provide a little motivation when you need it! For a little extra inspiration, you can also subscribe to my newsletter and I will remind you of your goals.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/IMG_8623.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-454\" src=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/IMG_8623.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_8623\" width=\"5472\" height=\"3648\" srcset=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/IMG_8623.jpg 5472w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/IMG_8623-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/IMG_8623-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/IMG_8623-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5472px) 100vw, 5472px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>1. Wake Up Early and Workout<\/p>\n<p>I only wake up early and workout two or three times a week. I dread it the night before, but when I finish the workout, I love that I did it early. I don\u2019t even need coffee to get me going-exercising is\u00a0my energizer!<\/p>\n<p>2. Take More Hikes<\/p>\n<p>I LOVE HIKING! I just never have enough time to do it as much as I want \ud83d\ude41 To me, hiking is more than just a work out. The fresh air and beautiful views make it a totally different workout experience. Hikes make me feel on top of the world- literally and physically!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/IMG_7013.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-455\" src=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/IMG_7013.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_7013\" width=\"3648\" height=\"4299\" srcset=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/IMG_7013.jpg 3648w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/IMG_7013-600x707.jpg 600w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/IMG_7013-255x300.jpg 255w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/IMG_7013-869x1024.jpg 869w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3648px) 100vw, 3648px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>3. \u00a0Practice More Yoga<\/p>\n<p>Honestly\u2026 I\u2019m horrible at yoga. I WISH I were good at it! So this year, instead of just wishing I were a yogi, I\u2019m going to start practicing beginner&#8217;s yoga and try my best to get better! There are so many benefits to practicing yoga; it&#8217;s overall mind and body experience.<\/p>\n<p>4. \u00a0Drink More Water<\/p>\n<p>This goal is something I need to incorporate in my daily life. Sometimes, I find myself only drinking two water bottles a day when I\u2019m at school. I think my issue is the lack of plastic water bottles I have in my apartment. SO- I got the perfect water bottle for Christmas. I plan to carry it everywhere with me so I\u2019m always drinking water. I notice my energy level increase significantly when I remember to drink more water!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/unnamed.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-453\" src=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/unnamed.jpg\" alt=\"unnamed\" width=\"417\" height=\"552\" srcset=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/unnamed.jpg 417w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/unnamed-227x300.jpg 227w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>5. Practice More Meditation<\/p>\n<p>In my health class, we practiced a new form of meditation every week for at least 20 minutes. Practicing meditation when I was anxious or tense was seriously one of the best stress relievers. Though I love it so much, I only practiced it\u00a0(or breathing exercises) a few times outside of the class. When I had someone proctor the meditation, it was so easy for me to do. Meditating regulary will no doubt be beneficial in lowering\u00a0my stress level!<\/p>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Every year, I think of things I want to focus on in the New Year.
