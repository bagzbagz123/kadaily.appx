It can be really hard to wake up in the morning and workout. Whether exercising early in the morning is your only option because you don&#8217;t have other time, or whether you just really like working out in the AM, here are my ten tips on how to get that energy and do it right.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Listen to Music<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Get out of your bed and put on some pump-up music. I always listen to songs that make me feel invincible in the morning because it gives me motivation to go get it done.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Stretch<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Take a couple minutes to stretch on your bed after waking up. This will help release tension in your muscles, and slowly wake you up. The blood circulation will give you energy. The stretching will get you loose and your body ready to go.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Prepare a Small Breakfast<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I like to prepare my breakfast the night before. It&#8217;s usually\u00a0two hard boiled eggs or some cut up fruit, or I will just get the ingredients ready to make some oatmeal, etc. Something quick and easy. For me, I can\u2019t eat a big breakfast right before I workout in the morning because I will feel heavy, or get a cramp:\/\u00a0I like to save a big tasty breakfast for afterwards- like a reward! Don&#8217;t skip this meal before you exercise in the AM! A smaller breakfast will give you energy, but will still keep you feeling light on your feet.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Sleep<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It sounds so obvious, but getting a good night sleep really\u00a0matters. Go to bed earlier than usual if you\u2019re waking up early to workout. It will make it soo much easier to get up. You won\u2019t feel tired or groggy if you get your beauty rest!<\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Set Alarm Titles<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This one\u2019s my favorite tip:) My alarm consists of two or three set times that I give titles\u00a0to. For example, one goes off at 6:30 saying \u201cBEING LAZY IS FOR THE WEAK.\u201d Hahah&#8230; These kinds of motivations that I give myself genuinely help me a lot. I look at my phone first thing in the morning to stop (or snooze) my alarm, and so it&#8217;s the first thing I read.\u00a0Below\u00a0is an example of what I mean, but tailor these alarm names to whatever inspires you to get up and get moving.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/fitbitjan23.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-864\" src=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/fitbitjan23.jpg\" alt=\"fitbitjan23\" width=\"320\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/fitbitjan23.jpg 320w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/fitbitjan23-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Organize Workout Clothes<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Set out what you are going to workout in the night before, and place the clothes right next to your bed. Even put out your shoes and socks. It\u2019ll make it so easy when you get up, so you don\u2019t have to drowsily search for workout clothes when you roll out of bed. Putting on your workout clothes is a huge step in getting yourself to workout. (Sounds stupid, but it&#8217;s so true) After you put them on, you\u2019re already halfway there. Once you have your sports bra and running\u00a0shoes on, it\u2019s like &#8220;OK I&#8217;M READY. LET&#8217;S DO IT.&#8221; Right? Right&#8230;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Splash\u00a0Your Face<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Splashing my face with cold water always wakes me up. It is a necessary morning ritual I will always do, no matter if I&#8217;m planning on working out or not. It helps me knock out that groggy morning feeling and get a burst of energy.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Think About that Post Workout Feeling<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Think about how awesome it will be when you\u2019re done with your workout in the morning and feel so great. Remind yourself how worth it it is. It\u2019s such a good feeling knowing you already worked out and don\u2019t have to think about it alllll day long! You will thank yourself afterwards and be happy you did it.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>Start Slow<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Not all of us can get up early and just go give it our all on some sprints, and that\u2019s okay!! (It&#8217;s hard for me, too!) Start out slow. If you have enough time, start by just walking\/skipping for about five to seven minutes. This will get your blood flowing, your energy up, and get you ready to go hard for\u00a0the rest of your workout. If you are planning to workout in the morning on most days, start out with just a light workout, then every day get a little more intense.\u00a0This is something that you can build up to&#8230; which brings me to my next tip!<\/p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>It&#8217;s All About Habit<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The more you wake up and workout, the easier it will get. It might be really hard for you at first, but it will become routine. Once you wake up early all the time, it just becomes a habit!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Let&#8217;s face it, not all of us are morning people!!
