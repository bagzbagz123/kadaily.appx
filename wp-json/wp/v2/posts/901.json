Here are tips on how to help you stay on track:<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t Beat Yourself Up<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>First and foremost, I just want to remind you not to beat yourself up over big and unhealthy meals, or skipping a day of working out. This time of year only happens once, and we are all human. I am with my family every Christmas (and they like to make HUGE meals!!), so I understand how it is difficult to maintain a balance between enjoying yourself and time with your family and maintaining healthy habits.\u00a0If you know you\u2019re going to be treating yourself, focus on working out a bit harder and getting back on track the next day. Although I&#8217;m not saying to overdo it every day, make sure you\u2019re still livin\u2019 it up and cherishing the holiday season.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Make Plans Ahead of Time<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Going off what I just said above, because you will be attending holiday parties, knowing when you might splurge, or if you know you\u2019re not going to have time to workout the next day, PLAN AHEAD! Maybe just come home a little early from holiday shopping to workout:) Even if it\u2019s just 20 minutes- it\u2019s better than nothing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Grab a Friend or Family Member<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Doing workouts with a buddy not only makes it ten times more fun, but it makes it easier to find the time. When I come home for winter break, I always just want to hang out with my friends that I haven\u2019t seen in forever or be with my cousins! So if this is the case for you too, why not include your friends and family in your workouts. Instead of sitting on the couch watching tv together, do a little in-home workout. It\u2019s a way to bond together and break a sweat at the same time!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Keep Track of What You Eat\/Drink<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>When you log a journal of what you eat and drink, you become more aware of what you are putting in your body. Keeping a journal (in your phone, computer, piece of paper, etc) helps you monitor <em>what <\/em>you\u2019re eating and <em>how <\/em>much. This is also a reminder that liquid calories add up. Make sure you keep track of how much you\u2019re drinking along with what you\u2019re eating (whether this is eggnog and hot chocolate, or an alcoholic beverage), because these drinks will add up. Even though it\u2019s okay to indulge in good holiday food over break, this just makes it easier to see when you\u2019re REALLY overdoing it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>In-Home Workouts<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>When I was in high school, I would workout in the snow and freeeeezing cold! I wish I knew I could do an in-home workout and actually make it effective. Now, I workout at home ALL the time because I mastered in-home workouts:) Sometimes in-home workouts are all I do during the week! I have lots of videos on my site that you can do in your living room or bedroom, and I have a whole e-book dedicated to in home workouts!!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Water Water Waterrrrrrrr<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>BIGGGGG glasses of water!! Sometimes, we mistake thirst for hunger!\u00a0 When you drink lots of water, you won\u2019t overeat as much. I especially like to drink a big glass of water right before a big meal!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>Holiday Party Food Tips<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>When you go to a holiday party, try to stay out of the \u201cfood table\u201d room. I always stand right next to the food table, tasting and trying the different dishes, and sometimes don\u2019t realize how much I eat!! Don&#8217;t tempt yourself.\u00a0Another secret\u00a0avoid overindulging at holiday parties is making sure you eat a protein-packed snack beforehand. That way you won&#8217;t be starving \u00a0by the time you arrive and will make better choices.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>BONUS:\u00a0Here are four more tips from last year\u2019s blog!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Don\u2019t skip meals:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This one is huge. I know during the holiday season I tend to eat more because I am always with my giant family (who makes the best and biggest meals ever). Some people will think that if you have a big meal for dinner, they are going to skip breakfast, or if you have a huge lunch you should skip dinner. This is not good! To <em>stay<\/em> fit you should not skip meals! This only messes with your metabolism. Just make it a lighter meal- but really try to stay on track with having breakfast, lunch and dinner!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Drink hot tea before a meal:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Drinking a cup of green tea will help you digest the big holiday meals you intake!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Layer up when you run:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When I was an athlete, I used to have games in the snow and hail. Yes this was dreadful, but once I found the clothing that kept me warm, I didn\u2019t mind it. Especially because when I started to run, I immediately warmed up. Fresh air is always good for you! (I use Under Armour- best cold gear ever!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Always keep your goals in your head:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Last but not least, remember how far you\u2019ve come and how much you want to attain your\u00a0goals. It\u2019s so easy to want to cuddle up on the couch in your bulky, winter clothing. But, focus on all the effort you&#8217;ve put in and how good you feel after excercising. Look ahead and realize how happy you will be if you keep up your fitness and nutrition during the winter! Look forward to the warmer months when pool parties are happening! Ambition is everything.<\/p>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Staying fit during the holiday season can be tough!!
