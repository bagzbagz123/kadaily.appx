Salads are great in theory, but every single morning when I\u2019m about to make my lunch, I\u2019m&nbsp;always stuck thinking\u2026how the heck are you supposed to add my dressing and not end up with a super soggy salad by lunchtime?!? &nbsp;Some past scenarios that I\u2019ve had with dressing, from my salad diaries:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either I\u2026.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>a) completely forget dressing, left with a lame, dry salad lol<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>b) put dressing on salad before i leave my house in the morning, salad is soaked and soggy and unbearable<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>c) try and find a small container to put dressing in, but can only find a massive one so transport dressing in that, looking and feeling absolutely ridiculous transporting such a massive container for like a tablespoon&nbsp;of dressing<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>d) or I bring an entire bottle of dressing and then I either forget it or it gets lost in the depths of the &nbsp;fridge with no chance of being found!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is AN EASY FIX! This is the right way to meal prep a salad, and let me tell you friends, you will NEVER be left eating a soggy salad ever again in your life!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https:\/\/studio.www.kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/IMG_6349-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-19317\" srcset=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/IMG_6349-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/IMG_6349-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/IMG_6349-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/IMG_6349-600x450.jpg 600w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/IMG_6349-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/IMG_6349-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/IMG_6349-800x600.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/studio.www.kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/IMG_6350-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-19318\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>First you start out with your dressing! I used tzatziki mix with olive oil and lemon juice because I\u2019m making a Greek inspired salad! We put this at the bottom of the container so that it won\u2019t get all of your ingredients soggy and wet before you\u2019re ready to eat!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you add anything that won\u2019t get soggy in your dressing! So I added the carrots first, then chickpeas, then sliced cucumbers, then chopped tomatoes! Then you can sprinkle in any cheese, I\u2019m using feta in my salad!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/studio.www.kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/IMG_6356-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-19320\" srcset=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/IMG_6356-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/IMG_6356-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/IMG_6356-600x800.jpg 600w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/IMG_6356-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/IMG_6356-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/IMG_6356-450x600.jpg 450w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/IMG_6356-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Last but not least, add your choice of greens!
