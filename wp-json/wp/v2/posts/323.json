As the days go on, it\u2019s getting colder!! Some people love the cold and find it more refreshing, but if you\u2019re like me\u2026 you hate it. You might find it harder to be motivated in the winter time because you aren\u2019t going to be wearing a bathing suit anytime soon and you just want to stay inside by the fire with hot chocolate. Also, let\u2019s be real. The food around the holiday time is the best thing ever&#8230; Here are seven tips on how to stay fit and focused in the upcoming months!!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/IMG_91371.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-327\" src=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/IMG_91371.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_9137\" width=\"2478\" height=\"2193\" srcset=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/IMG_91371.jpg 2478w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/IMG_91371-600x531.jpg 600w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/IMG_91371-300x265.jpg 300w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/IMG_91371-1024x906.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2478px) 100vw, 2478px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Fall in love with an indoor activity\/class:<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you love exercising outside, try an indoor activity! This will be great to switch up your routine, too. Some examples of what I do: pick-up basketball, spin class, zumba, hip hop, barre.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In-home workouts:<\/strong><br \/>\nIf even getting in your car to go somewhere sounds dreadful because of the cold, get creative in your own home! Blast some music in your house and use different pieces of furniture to do exercises on. Check out the different in-home workouts in the posts I have on this website!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Keep drinking water:<\/strong><br \/>\nSometimes we mistake dehydration for hunger. We still need to drink lots of water even when it&#8217;s cold outside. So make sure you\u2019re still drinking enough H20!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Don\u2019t skip meals:<\/strong><br \/>\nThis one is huge. I know during the holiday season I tend to eat more because I am always with my giant family (who makes the best and biggest meals ever). Some people will think that if you have a big meal for dinner, they are going to skip breakfast, or if you have a huge lunch you should skip dinner. This is not good! To <em>stay<\/em> fit you actually should not skip your meals! Just make it a lighter meal- but really try to stay on track with having breakfast, lunch and dinner!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Drink hot tea before a meal:<\/strong><br \/>\nDrinking a cup of green tea will help you digest the big holiday meals you intake!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Layer up when you run:<\/strong><br \/>\nWhen I was an athlete, I used to have games in the snow and hail. Yes this was dreadful, but once I found the clothing that kept me warm, I didn\u2019t mind it. Especially because when I started to run, I immediately warmed up. Fresh air is always good for you! (I use Under Armour- best cold gear ever!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Always keep your goals in your head:<\/strong><br \/>\nLast but not least, remember how far you\u2019ve come and how much you want to keep your goals. It\u2019s so easy to cover up in bulky clothing and sit on the couch, but focus on all the effort you have put in so far and all the good you felt when you were exercising. Look ahead and realize how happy you will be if you keep up your fitness and nutrition during the winter! Look forward to the warmer months when pool parties are happening! Ambition is everything.<\/p>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>HELLO WINTER!! Winter is in sight! As the days go on, it\u2019s getting colder!!
