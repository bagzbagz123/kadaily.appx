Trust me your body will thank you and<br>you will feel AMAZING!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Drink water before every meal.<\/strong><br>Thanksgiving dinner. My FAVORITE, also my worst enemy because I feel like I have to eat<br>EVERYTHING and multiple plates BUT my saving grace for not over indulging? Drink 2 glasses<br>of water before dinner that way it makes you feel fuller. You\u2019re both hydrating and preventing<br>yourself for going for thirds because lets be honest, seconds are inevitable!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Water a little too \u201cplain\u201d for ya?? Infuse it!!<\/strong><br>If drinking water isn\u2019t exciting enough for you then you can add some fresh fruit to help make it a<br>little more enticing!<br>\u2022&nbsp;<em>Lemon<\/em>&nbsp;\u2013 Not only does adding lemon make your water taste delicious but if<br>you\u2019re drinking it cold then it can help aid in weight loss! It also gives your immune<br>system a boost and the acids help to digest food and the best benefit is that the vitamin<br>C helps to reduce wrinkles-forever young!!!<br>\u2022&nbsp;<em>Ginger<\/em>&nbsp;\u2013 If you really want to add a kick to your H2O then try adding some ginger, it<br>helps with reducing inflammation and ladies if it\u2019s that time of the month this is a great<br>natural remedy for easing those totally unnecessary menstrual cramps!<br>\u2022&nbsp;<em>Cucumber<\/em>\u2013 A refreshing fav. of mine! Cucumbers help deliver antioxidants to your body<br>which helps in the prevention of cancer, diabetes and heart disease, they\u2019re also high in<br>vitamin K which helps to boost bone health!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/DSC00602-1-683x1024-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/DSC00602-1-683x1024-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33318\" srcset=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/DSC00602-1-683x1024-1.jpg 683w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/DSC00602-1-683x1024-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/DSC00602-1-683x1024-1-600x900.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Challenge yourself to those 8 glasses a day.<br>I know I know 8 glasses of water a day sounds like a TON but you can do it!! The 8\u00d78 rule<br>makes it easy to remember ( 8 glasses of 8 ounces).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Find a favorite water bottle.<\/strong><br>8 glasses a day not practical enough with your busy schedule?? It\u2019s ok, you can still get all of<br>the water you need by simply carrying around a water bottle! Think of it as your new sidekick-<br>whether you\u2019re sitting at your desk or on the go to your next meeting it\u2019s a great reminder for<br>you to sip BEFORE you\u2019re thirsty! If you\u2019re only drinking water when you\u2019re thirsty that\u2019s no<br>bueno because it\u2019s an indicator you\u2019re dehydrated. Drink. Refill. REPEAT!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sip up everybody!! Remember it just starts with 1 cup in the morning, you will slowly but surely<br>get into the habit of drinking all of the water you need. Find what works for you and stick to it!<br>Stay hydrated my loves!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>xx Katie<\/p>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hi everyonneeee!!! So lets get down to it.Water. H2O.
