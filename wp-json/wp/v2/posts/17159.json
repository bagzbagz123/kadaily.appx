My first tip is to first go for the health-IER sides.\u00a0The green beans, corn side, etc. Try to fill your plate first with the veggies and greens. Another favorite alternative of mine is substituting sweet potato casserole smothered with melted marshmallows, for roasted sweet potatoes with honey and cinnamon. This is the perfect little dish to help satisfy your sweet tooth and boost your beta-carotene intake which is amazingggg for fueling your brain! Then, I loveee adding in a little bit of cauliflower in the mashed potatoes. Nobody will even notice!! Y\u2019all already know how much I love my water so I of course had to throw in an H2O related tip for you! Drink a glass or two before digging into mama\u2019s delightful cooking that way you can feel fuller and won\u2019t over eat!! Last but not least, eat a little slower and with good posture. Sometimes we tend to stuff our face SOOO fast (me), and to enjoy every bite, try to eat slower. That way we won\u2019t over eat AS much. Plus, with good posture, we can feel when we\u2019re pretty full. I hope you all enjoy the holiday with your family &amp; friends and remember, if you\u2019re going for that second plate, NO WORRIES!! Lunge your way back into the kitchen, because we only live once. Enjoy every moment of Thanksgiving day, because it only happens once a year. Eat your grandmas pumpkin pie, your great aunts dish, etc., because to be honest, you really never know how long you\u2019re going to be able to indulge in dishes cooked by them. Ok sorry for just being a downer hahaha \u2013 but I would give anything to have my grandma or my uncles cooking again. Appreciate every second. Tell your family how much you love them!! Love you guys! xx Katie<\/p>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Happy Holidays my loves!!!
