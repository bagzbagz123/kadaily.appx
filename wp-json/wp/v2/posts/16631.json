And by the time it&#8217;s 8 pm, you know you shoulda just got it done at 5 pm? Welp, we&#8217;ve all been there. Here are my tips to avoid that ever happening again, so you can just get off your butt and get to it:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Plan your <a style=\"color:inherit;text-decoration:inherit;font-family:inherit;\" href=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/video-category\/full-body\/\">workout<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Know what you\u2019re going to do. Run? HIIT? Yoga? Dance cardio? What are you about to do? Invision it in your head, and picture yourself doing it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lie to yourself<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ok ok don\u2019t ever LIE to yourself, but I swear this method always works on me. When I\u2019m dreading a workout, I\u2019m like \u201cok Katie all you have to do is ten minutes. that\u2019s it!!\u201d And that gets me going because anyoneeee can do ten minutes. Then, when I get started in that workout, I feel so good after ten minutes I 90% of the time keep going to 30 min.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Schedule the WHEN<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I like scheduling out when I am going to workout the day before. And I don\u2019t mean when like in the morning or afternoon. I mean a specific time like 2 pm. 8 am. As if it\u2019s a class or work and you must be there on the dot.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lace up your shoes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sounds like the simplest thing ever, but seriously just putting on running shoes can sometimes motivate me. It gives me that feeling that I just want to get up and get at it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Get Inspo<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Watch some workout videos on Insta\/youtube to get ideas and inspiration for your workout. (but not over 5 minutes bc damn i\u2019ve done that and lost track of time and next thing you know I\u2019m on my cousins boyfriends sisters wedding from 2009- be careful out there) Maybe you\u2019ll find some new moves you want to try, or just get motivated!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Think about food<\/strong><br \/>\nSo whenever I&#8217;m feeling poopy and like &#8220;nah today I can skip&#8221; I legit think about my next amazing cheat meal. Like Italian this Friday night. Or Taco Tuesday night. Or Sunday pizza and football. And I say to myself- &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to <em>deserve<\/em> that meal and not feel guilty about it?&#8221; And hey, can&#8217;t lie, it usually works.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Turn off your electronics<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s hardddd I know, but put your phone in airplane mode. Put down your computer. Anything that\u2019s distracting you to workout. Because I guarantee when you don\u2019t have anyone to text, or stalk on social media, you\u2019ll be bored and FINALLY workout.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Play a fire song<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Bump some jams. This one\u2019s a given. Put on some rap or anything that makes you wanna DANCE. Music gives me so much energy. (Side note: all time song that makes me happy- Teach me how to dougie hahaha)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tell someone you\u2019re about to workout<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This one might sound weird, but it actually helps. Tell your friend, mom, boyfriend, roommate, that you\u2019re about to workout. (maybe not like out of nowhere but if someone asks you in the convo what you\u2019re going to do that day) Sometimes when my best friend or boyfriend asks me, \u201cwhat are you up to today?\u201d and I respond with \u201ca workout\u201d as part of my answer, I almost feel as if I have to\u2026 Telling someone you\u2019re about to go do something keeps you accountable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Think about the AFTER<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Visualize that post workout feeling you\u2019re going to have after you workout. How AMAZING you will feel about yourself, and how mature you feel for not wasting an hour or two procrastinating it!!!! Like come on- #ADULTING. Also, maybe not something I should be saying coming from a girl who always says &#8220;focus on yourself&#8221; &#8211; WHICH YOU SHOULD &#8211; but let&#8217;s be real here for a sec. Think about the AFTER of how hawwwwt you will look. Think about that revenge bod. (Obviously still focus on yourself for the most part, but come on a little bit of fire won&#8217;t hurt)<\/p>\n<p>And if you\u2019re one of those people reading this right now because you\u2019re procrastinating your workout\u2026\u2026. just go. Get up and do it already girl!!!!! IT\u2019LL BE WORTH IT!!!!<\/p>\n"},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ever feel like you&#8217;ve wasted hours just THINKING about working out?
