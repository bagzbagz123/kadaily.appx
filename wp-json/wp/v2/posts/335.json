The World Health Organization called for the reduction of our sugar intake to a small 5% of our daily calories. That\u2019s only about 90-100 calories per day of sugar!!! Here are some foods that might be disguised as healthy that you should try to steer clear from\u263a<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/DSC_05601.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-338\" src=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/DSC_05601.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_0560\" width=\"4842\" height=\"4000\" srcset=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/DSC_05601.jpg 4842w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/DSC_05601-600x496.jpg 600w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/DSC_05601-300x247.jpg 300w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/DSC_05601-1024x845.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4842px) 100vw, 4842px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>1. <strong>DRIED FRUIT<\/strong>\u2028\u2028Dried fruit may as well be candy\u2026 It\u2019s great to have once in a while, just like a candy treat! It\u2019s filled with concentrated sugar. Try to stick to fresh fruit instead\u263a<\/p>\n<p>2. <strong>CEREAL\u2028<\/strong>\u2028One time, my friend told me she was on an \u201call cereal diet\u2026\u201d This scared me. It came as a shock to me that most do not understand that cereal is not as healthy as you think. Cereal contains so much added sugar, surprisingly even the so-called \u201cwhole grain cereals.\u201d Most of the popular cereals are rice clumped together with sugar and fat. I love Raisin Brand, and for the longest time I thought I was having a nice healthy breakfast- I was mistaken. It\u2019s like having sugar coated paper\u2026no nutritional value. Try Kashi if you love cereal!<\/p>\n<p>3. <strong>FRUIT YOGURT<\/strong>\u2028\u2028Every single type of yogurt contains at least some sugar in the form of lactose (milk sugar). Watch out for the \u201cfruit at the bottom\u201d yogurts, especially. Check the nutrition facts and make sure that no ingredient says \u201chigh fructose corn syrup.\u201d\u2028This is one of the most potent and toxic ingredients you can put in your body!<\/p>\n<p>4. <strong>\u2028SALAD DRESSING<\/strong>\u2028\u2028Salad dressing can be so fattening. Even if you go for the fat-free dressings, they are filled with salt and sugars to make up for the lack of flavor. The fruity vinaigrettes contain so much sugar! When you go to a restaurant and feel like being healthy, ask for the dressing on the side, so YOU can control how much you\u2019re putting on the salad! Or try this simple and easy recipe that is sure to make any salad taste amazing: olive oil, lemon juice from half of a lemon, splash of balsamic, and pinch of salt and pepper!<\/p>\n<p>5. <strong>ARTIFICIAL SMOOTHIES\/JUICE<\/strong> I once had an obsession with Jamba Juice and Smoothie King\u2026 I thought I was being healthy\u2026 These kinds of smoothies are often made with ice cream, milk, or frozen yogurt, and can be crammed with sugar. Make your smoothies at home with frozen fruit and sugar-free yogurt\u263a The labels on juices can be so deceiving. You think you\u2019re in the clear because it says, \u201cmade with real fruit,\u201d but honestly that can mean 10% or just once slice of an apple. Make sure you\u2019re buying the juices that say \u201c100% pure fruit juice.\u201d Stay in the clear from \u201ccocktail\u201d juice as well!<\/p>\n<p>PS. Since we are in the holiday season, I\u2019m just going to put it out there! The pumpkin spice and peppermint holiday drinks\u2026. Stay away.
