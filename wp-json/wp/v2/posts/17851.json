I miss being around other humans or working at a cute coffee shop!! BUT we all got sh*t to do &amp; things we want to accomplish, so we must adapt.. and I\u2019m not gonna lie, finding the motivation everyday can be challenging AF.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to also note to you guys one of my favorite entrepnurenual quotes: WORK SMARTER NOT HARDER. I used to work for 12 hours a day, doing random digital shit that was SO unnecessary. Once you time block, and realize bigger things that are important to get done, you can get back so many hours in a day. You do NOT need to overwork yourself. I will actually write an entirely other blog post about this soon because I have a lot to say!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After ~I don\u2019t even know how many days\u2026weeks\u2026months~ I\u2019ve finally figured out what\u2019s been working for me to help keep me on track and I\u2019m sharing the goods with you so you too can be productive while working from home!<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Workout First Thing In The A.M.<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working from home sounds good in theory because you\u2019re prob. able to sleep in a little longer but TRUST ME when I say, working out in the morning is a great way to boost your energy &amp; jumpstart your day! As hard as it may be to get your butt out of bed, it\u2019s honestly easier to just get it out of the way so you don\u2019t have to worry about finding the time later on to do it. You will feel more productive, focused, and energized for your day after a morning workout. I also recommend whipping up a good<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/food\/5-smoothies-you-must-try\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">post-workout smoothie<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> so you can really fuel up for the day!<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Set &amp; Stick To Work Hours<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flexibility when it comes to #WFH has been one of the things I\u2019ve struggled the most with. It\u2019s so easy to get distracted and do other things rather than focusing on actual work. By setting &amp; sticking to work hours you not only hold yourself accountable for that time, but it also helps you to avoid overworking yourself. Especially if you work in social media like me, your job can be 24\/7, but I promise you setting boundaries to your work is so helpful.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Create A Dedicated Work Space<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listen, I\u2019m the first to admit I LOVE working from my bed or my comfy couch,&nbsp; but wow I did not realize how much more work I could get done until I actually tried sitting at a desk. Working from your bed or couch can signal relaxation to your mind, so to be as productive as possible it\u2019s important you create a dedicated work space- this includes a desk, a comfortable chair, preferably in a room where you can close the door for privacy (this is more so necessary for those who live with a roommate, partner or family.) You can also help to make your work space a little more appealing by setting it up in an area with a lot of light, keeping it tidy and having a cute plant; I personally like snake plants cause they\u2019re low maintenance so I have a pretty good chance of NOT killing it! LOL<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Take Breaks<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take..and I can not stress this enough..BREAKS. Make sure you set a lunch hour and take regular 5-10 minute breathers whenever you feel yourself losing energy- get up, stretch, make a snack, have a dance party and then get right back into it! This is soooo important so your brain doesn\u2019t experience a burnout. Taking small breaks will help you re-focus.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Communicate, Communicate, COMMUNICATE<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your job, side hustle or whatever it is you do while working from home requires a team that normally works together in person, then it\u2019s important all levels of communication are stepped up so you can all stay on top of your game. If you need a little help on a project, don\u2019t just toss it to the side and say \u201cI\u2019ll deal with that later,\u201d let your team know and rely on their support! Emails and texts can be tricky when it comes to context and even tone, so I highly recommend setting up Google hangouts, Zoom meetings, Facetime calls, whatever your preference so you can at least SEE and communicate with each other a little easier-plus it\u2019s just nice to have a little human interaction even if it is virtual. In my opinion, it&#8217;s so much easier to pick up the phone and call someone than an email in depth explaining whatcha need.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Limit Distractions<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m the type of girl who will be writing an email, then will get a text from a friend of a tiktok post, and then SOMEHOW spend an hour on tiktok and completely forget about the email I was sending. I am SO easily distracted lol. To limit your phone time, set some reminders\/alarms on phone, and if you have an iPhone you can actually get notifications when you&#8217;re spending too much time on your screen. Whenever I&#8217;m editing a video with a deadline, I turn on do not disturb on my phone. I probably save SO much time doing that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Healthy Snacking<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love to snack on mini little healthy things when I am deep in work. Also, brain power, duh. Grapes, popcorn, cherries, carrots.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Plan Ahead<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m all about living in the moment and just going with the flow, but when it comes to productivity, planning ahead is KEY. I\u2019ve found it to be super helpful when I write out a To-Do list the night ahead. (you&#8217;re probably like, yeah duhhh Katie..) But I write down everything I want to accomplish for the day and <strong>I list my top priorities first<\/strong> to make sure I tackle those and get them completed- save the less urgent tasks for the afternoon when your energy starts to decrease. As old school as it may sound, writing out a list really does help to hold me accountable, keep me organized and it honestly feels good when I start crossing off everything on my list. My best advice for prioritizing and lists, is to download an app. I use an app thats actually no longer available to download (HAHA worst advice) BUT I just searched in the app store for a &#8220;to-do list&#8221; and OMG there are hundreds of amazing apps to help you. Physically checking off a box always helps me <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">feel productive.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/DSC00668-scaled-e1597692534265-1024x1024-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/DSC00668-scaled-e1597692534265-1024x1024-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33145\" srcset=\"https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/DSC00668-scaled-e1597692534265-1024x1024-1.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/DSC00668-scaled-e1597692534265-1024x1024-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/DSC00668-scaled-e1597692534265-1024x1024-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/DSC00668-scaled-e1597692534265-1024x1024-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/DSC00668-scaled-e1597692534265-1024x1024-1-500x500.jpg 500w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/DSC00668-scaled-e1597692534265-1024x1024-1-600x600.jpg 600w, https:\/\/kadaily.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/DSC00668-scaled-e1597692534265-1024x1024-1-100x100.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These may sound like simple tips but they really do help!!
